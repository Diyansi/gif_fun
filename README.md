# gif_fun

This is a fun web project where you can ask someone if they will go out with you. If they hover over the "No" button, it will move to a random position on the screen, making it hard to click. If they click "Yes", a celebratory GIF will be displayed.

## Project Structure

- `ht.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the web page.
- `js.js`: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity to the web page.
- `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the project.

## How to Run

1. Open `ht.html` in a web browser.
2. Interact with the buttons to see the effects.
